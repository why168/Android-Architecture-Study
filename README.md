| Sample | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [MVP](./Android-Architecture-MVP) | Demonstrates a basic [Model‑View‑Presenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) (MVP) architecture and provides a foundation on which the other samples are built. This sample also acts as a reference point for comparing and contrasting the other samples in this project. |
| [MVP-Clean](./Android-Architecture-MVP-Clean) | Uses concepts from [Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html). |
| [MVP-Dagger](./Android-Architecture-MVP-Dagger) | Uses [Dagger 2](https://google.github.io/dagger/) to add support for [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection). |
| [MVP-RxJava](./Android-Architecture-MVP-RxJava) | Uses [RxJava 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) to implement concurrency, and abstract the data layer. |
| [MVP-Kotlin](./Android-Architecture-MVP-Kotlin) | Conversion of todo-mvp to Kotlin. |
